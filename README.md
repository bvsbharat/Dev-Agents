# 🚀 Dev-Agents

> **AI-powered web development agents that build, refine, and deploy full-stack apps right from your browser — no setup required.**

---

## 🧠 What is Dev-Agents?

**Dev-Agents** is a next-generation AI system for **frontend software generation** that does more than just write code. It builds **fully functional, beautifully designed UIs** by orchestrating a team of intelligent agents that work together — like a digital dev studio in your browser. From design interpretation to interaction logic, from debugging to deployment, Dev-Agents has it covered.

Whether you're building a dashboard, marketing site, or internal tool, Dev-Agents turns your prompts into production-ready apps using a powerful **multi-agent workflow** and **deep contextual awareness**.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🎨 **Design Agent** – Interprets visual mockups and brand guidelines.
- 💻 **Code Agent** – Generates clean, modular, and responsive HTML/CSS/JS (React).
- 🔄 **Interaction Agent** – Handles user interactions and dynamic behaviors.
- ✅ **Validation Agent** – Ensures accessibility, responsiveness, and browser compatibility.

- 📄 **Context-Aware** – Reads CLAUDE.md-style files to align with your codebase conventions.
- 🧠 **Visual Understanding** – Can interpret Figma designs, screenshots, and wireframes.
- 🔁 **Iterative Refinement** – Uses live feedback loops (e.g., screenshots, user edits) to improve UI quality.
- 🚀 **Deploy-Ready** – Apps can be previewed, edited, and shipped directly in-browser.

## 🛠 Architecture

Dev-Agents uses a **Multi-Agent Workflow Architecture** inspired by Microsoft AutoGen. The process is split into four specialized stages:

1. **Design Interpretation**
2. **Code Generation**
3. **Behavior Implementation**
4. **Validation & Refinement**

Agents communicate through defined interfaces and context channels, sharing screenshots, specs, and feedback to collaboratively improve output.

## 🔍 Use Case Examples

- Build a startup landing page from a prompt like:  
  `"I need a hero section with a call-to-action button and testimonials."`
- Import a Figma mockup and get responsive, accessible code in seconds.
- Continuously refine UI based on visual previews or user preferences.
